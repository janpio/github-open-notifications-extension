`/lib/d3.v4.min.js` is from https://d3js.org/

Exact version is:
- https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/4.4.4/d3.min.js
- https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/blob/master/ajax/libs/d3/4.4.4/d3.min.js
You get to the non-minified version by removing the `.min` from these links.

(There is no official non-CDN link on Github or d3's website for both minified and unminified old versions of the library, as specified here: https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki#installing.)

https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v4.4.4 links to a .zip containing a `d3.min.js` and file with the same content though and also contains a unminified `d3.js`.
